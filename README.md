NikePlusGallery
===============
This app fetches the images from a JSON URL. In portrait mode, the images and its corresponding title is displayed in a GridView. In landscape mode, the images are displayed in a Carousel. The JSON response and image URLS are cached in SQLite. The images are cached in the memory in a key-value format where the image url is the key and the bitmap image itself is the value.
